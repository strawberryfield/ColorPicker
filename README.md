# Example Usage<a name="example">

See [ColorPickerDemo](https://github.com/PixiEditor/ColorPicker/tree/master/ColorPickerDemo) for an example project.

**Basic usage:**

Install the NuGet package, insert a reference to the ColorPicker namespace
```
<Window ...
xmlns:colorpicker="clr-namespace:ColorPicker;assembly=ColorPicker"
...>
```
Add the controls
```
<colorpicker:StandardColorPicker x:Name="main" />
<colorpicker:PortableColorPicker ColorState="{Binding ElementName=main, Path=ColorState, Mode=TwoWay}"/>
```
# Properties<a name="properties">

All controls share these properties:

- `ColorState` dependency property contains all info about the current state of the control. Use this property to bind controls together.
- `Color` property contains nested properties you may bind to or use to retrieve the color in code-behind:
    - `Color.A`: Current Alpha, a double ranging from 0 to 255
    - `Color.RGB_R`, `Color.RGB_G`, `Color.RGB_B`: Dimensions of the RGB color space, each is a 0-255 double
    - `Color.HSV_H`: Hue in HSV color space, a 0-360 double 
    - `Color.HSV_S`: Saturation in HSV color space, a 0-100 double
    - `Color.HSV_V`: Value in HSV color space, a 0-100 double
- `SelectedColor` dependency property stores the current color as System.Windows.Media.Color
- `ColorChanged`: An event that fires on SelectedColor change.

Apart from those, some controls have unique properties:

- `SecondColorState`, `SecondColor`, and `SecondaryColor` are functionally identical to `ColorState`, `Color`, and `SelectedColor` respectively. 
Those are present on controls that have a secondary color.
- `SmallChange` lets you change `SmallChange` of sliders, which is used as sensitivity for when the user
turns the scroll wheel with the cursor over the sliders. Present on controls with sliders.
- `ShowAlpha` lets you hide the alpha channel on various controls. 
Present on all controls containing either an alpha slider (apart from the `AlphaSlider` control itself) or a hex color textbox.
- `PickerType`: HSV or HSL, present on `SquarePicker` or controls that contain `SquarePicker`.

# Styling<a name="styling">

Out of the box, the color picker uses the default WPF look:

You may use the included dark theme by loading a resource dictionary in XAML:
```
<Window.Resources>
    <ResourceDictionary>
        <ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
            <ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/ColorPicker;component/Styles/DefaultColorPickerStyle.xaml" />
        </ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
    </ResourceDictionary>
</Window.Resources>
```
and referencing DefaultColorPickerStyle in the style attribute of a control:
```
<colorpicker:StandardColorPicker Style="{StaticResource DefaultColorPickerStyle}" />
```

As an alternative, the same can be achieved programmatically:
```
var resourceDictionary = new ResourceDictionary();
resourceDictionary.Source = new System.Uri(
    "pack://application:,,,/ColorPicker;component/Styles/DefaultColorPickerStyle.xaml",
    System.UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute);

StandardColorPicker picker = new StandardColorPicker()
{
    Style = (Style)resourceDictionary["DefaultColorPickerStyle"]
};
```

You may define your own styles, see 
[DefaultColorPickerStyle](https://github.com/PixiEditor/ColorPicker/blob/master/src/ColorPicker/Styles/DefaultColorPickerStyle.xaml) 
for reference.
